## Version R1 Has been postponed. (02/18/2021)

Release 1 has been postponed until further notice (probably going to be another week if things dont go haywire). Due to an incident i would prefer not to discuss any further that happened this morning, i will be unable to roll out R1 today. Sadly. Thankfully no other bugs have been found so if you want to use this mod, i prefer using Release b3 for the time being. Additionally this would expand the time period for finding bugs before R1 Releases so if you find any bugs with this mod i strongly suggest that you would want to open an issue thread. Thank you for your attention.

## What is this?

this is an attempt at creating my mod with fabricmc, it shows you in logs on how muck time it took to load minecraft.

## How do i use it?

use the Output Log/console and then it would show you how much time it took to load minecraft

## What inspired me to make this mod?

so there was this one mod for forge 1.8.9 Called "Patcher" It is an Optimization Mod Made My A Person Named By sk1er. There Was this one feature that showed you How long Minecraft took to start up, i really liked the feature But however i couldn't find any mod in the Fabricmc toolchain that could do that exact feature so i decided to make one myself. It Honestly Took me About 2 Days To Create this mod From the ground up due to the lack of knowledge knowing the java language but i finally got it to work! Hooray for me!
